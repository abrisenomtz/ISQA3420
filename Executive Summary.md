##Executive Summary

            Open source software has provided corporations the opportunity to improve development processes and ultimately 
    increase productivity and revenue.Companies are taking advantage of the vast availability of open source software to 
    lower their costs by modifying existing code which allows them to increase efficiency and profit. In the actual 
    software industry this approach is imperative to achieve competency in the market, companies that fully engage 
    open source software will have incredible benefits and those who reject the idea will suffer the consequences. [1]
    Collaborative development not only represents prosperity for corporations, it also signifies danger and risks to the 
    corporation’s environment. Organization structure is a crucial factor in order to appropriately manage licenses and 
    vulnerabilities involved in open source software. Any organization involved in open source should be properly structured 
    to provide an effective incorporation of open source code.  As the Linux Foundation stated “companies that have been 
    using and participating in open source… and have found success typically follow many of the same best practices… for 
    establishing open source mastery within a company”. [2]
